#Create a Python program that checks whether a person is eligible to vote (18 years or older) based on their age.

# Take age as input from user
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# Printing the age
print(age)
